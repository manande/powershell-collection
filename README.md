# powershell-collection

This is a collection of PowerShell scripts that I created to have a nicer experience on Windows.


## setup guide for beginners

For a simple, yet nice PowerShell experience on Windows, I recommend:  
* WinGet for installing and updating software: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/
* Windows Terminal: https://github.com/microsoft/terminal
* starship prompt: https://github.com/starship/starship

To try out the scripts, you can run them using the `pwsh` command.  
To run the scripts using a custom name, you can extend your PowerShell profile with aliases. Check out [PowerShell_profile-Examples.ps1](./PowerShell_profile-Examples.ps1) for some examples. To edit your profile, e.g. using vscode, use `code $PROFILE`.
